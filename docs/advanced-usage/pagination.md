#### Pagination

This package doesn't provide any methods to help you paginate responses. However as documented above you can use Laravel's default [`paginate()` method](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/pagination).

If you want to completely adhere to the JSON API specification you can also use our own [spatie/json-api-paginate](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-json-api-paginate)!
